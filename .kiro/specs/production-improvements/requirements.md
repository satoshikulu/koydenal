# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Bu feature, KöydenDirekt platformunun production-ready hale gelmesi için kritik üç sorunu çözmeyi amaçlamaktadır:

1. **Image Upload Entegrasyonu**: Gerçek resim yükleme işlevselliğinin CreateAd sayfasına entegre edilmesi
2. **Test Coverage**: Temel unit ve integration testlerinin eklenmesi
3. **Production Optimizasyonları**: Performans, güvenlik ve deployment iyileştirmeleri

Bu iyileştirmeler, platformun güvenilir, performanslı ve sürdürülebilir bir şekilde production ortamına alınmasını sağlayacaktır.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Image Upload Entegrasyonu

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new listing THEN the system SHALL allow uploading up to 5 images
2. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate file type (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF)
3. WHEN a user selects an image file THEN the system SHALL validate file size (max 50MB per file)
4. WHEN an image is uploaded THEN the system SHALL display a preview immediately
5. WHEN an image upload fails THEN the system SHALL show a user-friendly error message
6. WHEN a user removes an uploaded image THEN the system SHALL delete it from storage
7. WHEN a listing is submitted THEN the system SHALL save all image URLs to the database
8. WHEN a listing is submitted THEN the first uploaded image SHALL be set as main_image
9. IF no images are uploaded THEN the system SHALL use a placeholder image
10. WHEN images are uploading THEN the system SHALL show a loading indicator with progress

### Requirement 2: Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage, so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL execute unit tests for all utility functions
2. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL execute component tests for critical UI components
3. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL execute integration tests for authentication flow
4. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL execute integration tests for listing creation flow
5. WHEN the test suite runs THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 60% code coverage
6. WHEN a test fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages
7. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL fail the build if tests fail
8. WHEN storage functions are tested THEN the system SHALL use mocked Supabase client
9. WHEN auth functions are tested THEN the system SHALL use mocked authentication
10. WHEN components are tested THEN the system SHALL use React Testing Library

### Requirement 3: Production Optimizasyonları

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want the application to be optimized for production, so that users have a fast, secure, and reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application builds for production THEN the system SHALL enable code splitting
2. WHEN the application builds for production THEN the system SHALL minify all JavaScript and CSS
3. WHEN the application builds for production THEN the system SHALL optimize images
4. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL lazy load non-critical components
5. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL preload critical resources
6. WHEN environment variables are used THEN the system SHALL validate all required variables at startup
7. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN the system SHALL NOT expose it in client-side code
8. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log them to a monitoring service
9. WHEN the application is deployed THEN the system SHALL serve assets from CDN
10. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL implement proper error boundaries
11. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic for failed requests
12. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL achieve a Lighthouse score of at least 80

### Requirement 4: Security Enhancements

**User Story:** As a platform owner, I want enhanced security measures, so that user data and the platform are protected from vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN admin password is stored THEN the system SHALL NOT store it in plain text in .env
2. WHEN admin authentication occurs THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Auth instead of password comparison
3. WHEN file uploads occur THEN the system SHALL validate file content (not just extension)
4. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting
5. WHEN user input is processed THEN the system SHALL sanitize all inputs
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL NOT expose sensitive information in error messages
7. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL redirect users to login page
8. WHEN CORS is configured THEN the system SHALL only allow requests from authorized domains

### Requirement 5: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want improved development tools and documentation, so that I can work efficiently and onboard new team members easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is cloned THEN the system SHALL include a comprehensive README with setup instructions
2. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide a test script in package.json
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL run pre-commit hooks for linting
4. WHEN the application is built THEN the system SHALL provide clear build output
5. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages
6. WHEN API functions are used THEN the system SHALL have JSDoc comments
7. WHEN components are created THEN the system SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
8. WHEN the project structure is viewed THEN the system SHALL have a clear folder organization

## Success Metrics

1. **Image Upload Success Rate**: >95% of image uploads should succeed
2. **Test Coverage**: Minimum 60% code coverage across the codebase
3. **Lighthouse Performance Score**: >80 for all pages
4. **Build Time**: <2 minutes for production build
5. **Bundle Size**: <500KB for main bundle (gzipped)
6. **Error Rate**: <1% of user actions should result in errors
7. **Time to Interactive**: <3 seconds on 3G connection

## Out of Scope

- Mobile app development
- Payment system integration
- Real-time messaging system
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Multi-language support
- Email notification system

## Dependencies

- Supabase account with storage bucket configured
- Node.js 18+ and npm/yarn
- Testing libraries (Vitest, React Testing Library)
- Build optimization tools (already included in Vite)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Image upload failures | High | Medium | Implement retry logic and clear error messages |
| Test suite slows down development | Medium | Low | Use watch mode and run only affected tests |
| Bundle size increases | Medium | Medium | Implement code splitting and lazy loading |
| Breaking changes during refactoring | High | Medium | Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring |
| Supabase storage limits | Medium | Low | Implement image compression and size limits |

## Timeline Estimate

- **Image Upload Integration**: 2-3 days
- **Test Coverage**: 3-4 days
- **Production Optimizations**: 2-3 days
- **Security Enhancements**: 1-2 days
- **Documentation & Polish**: 1 day

**Total Estimated Time**: 9-13 days
